# Discover Mercury – A11y Practice Site

Welcome to the **Discover Mercury** fake travel site! This project is designed as a realistic, imperfect website to help you practice and refine your accessibility (a11y) testing skills.

> 🚀 This is *not* a real travel agency. It’s a deliberately flawed project created by NSquared for accessibility training and testing purposes.
